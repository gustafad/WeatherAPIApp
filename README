To launch the application, open the project in VisualStudio 2019 and press run. If any problem arrised, up on request I could publish the application to a web hotel and it could be launched from there.

This program was developed in "VisualStudio 2019 Community Edition" alongside the "Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc" package and "bootstrap". Thus a few nessesary files have not been created by me or edited by me.
The files that have been developed from scratch are listed below:

Controllers
  HomeController.cs
  
Models
  City.cs
  Clouds.cs
  Coord.cs
  CurrentWeatherDTO.cs
  FiveDaysWeatherForecastDTO.cs
